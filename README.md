# ReactorControl
A program for monitoring a nuclear reactor from IC2 using OpenComputers

To control the reactor, you need:
1) Build a reactor (Not liquid). Its equipment is not important for the program.
2) Install the red controller and adapter from the OpenComputers mod (Important! Connect the adapter and controller blocks to the reactor so that they connect only one side to the reactor, in order to avoid conflicts)
3) Connect the installed units to your computer using a cable. Try to connect in such a way that the wire does not intersect with other blocks of controllers and adapters. Otherwise, there may be conflicts
4) Of the system requirements, except for a network card and 8 kilobytes of free space
5) Download/copy the executable file
6) Ready! You can run the program

The keys used in the program:
O - turn on the reactor
C - turn off the reactor
Q - exiting the program
